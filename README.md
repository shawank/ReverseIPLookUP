# ReverseIPLookUP
This script takes the list of IP address as input, does a IP to geolocation lookup and writes back into a file. 
Support for visualization on the world map would added too. 
Note: Generalization is not the key idea here because this would be integrated back with the DNSQueryDB at a later point

##Requirements
matplotlib
mpl_toolkits.basemap
apscheduler (if jobs are to be scheduled at TTL)
